###Branch Names

1. Local branch has a simple name such as 'master'.

   This name is used as the default branch name if you didn't specify a particular name when you do <code>git init</code>.

2. Remote branches have names such as 'origin/master'.

   'origin' is the remote repo name.

3. Names 'origin' and 'master' don't have any special meanings, they are merely default names given by Git.

###Local Branch

1. Local branches are branches residing on your local dev box, you can have multiple branches on one box doing separate jobs.

   e.g, you can have one branch 'master' to keep track with the remote branch, have 'bugfix' to fix bugs, and also have 'new-feature' to implement new features.

   Branching is fairly light-weight in Git because creating a new branch is merely creating a new reference to a commit.

2. Local branches can be used to track remote branches.

   When you create a new repo using <code>git clone</code>, git will set up a master branch for you and make it a tracking branch for the repo you cloned. And next time you do <code>git pull/git push/git fetch/git checkout</code>, git will know which remote to talk to without explicitely told.

###Remote Branch

1. Remote branches are branches residing on remote boxes. Now that Git is a distributed version control system, every repo are of same weight, which means there is no main branch and sub branch. Remote branch is actually a relative concept. But in real life, we normally have a central server to serve as main repo though.
   
2. You can add a remote (server) using <code>git remote add</code> command.

3. <code>git fetch</code> does not merge the fetched branch with your local branch, to merge it, you have a call <code>git merge</code> after that.

4. <code>git fetch</code> will the reference to the remote branch to your local, without any real editable files. To edit files, you have to use <code>git checkout</code> to checkout the code to a local branch(either existing or newly created).
