I am now busy preparing for the upcoming interviews for my summer internship. Hope I will receive a good offer.

Making preparations for the summer interview is both easy and hard. It's easy because there are tons of useful resources on the web. It's hard because you can never be fully prepared no matter how many hours of work you have invested on this matter.

I actually learnt a lot during the preparation. My first major is not Computer Science so I was not very familiar with some of the basic knowledge of this area. But as the process went on, I found myself more and more familiar with all the concepts of data structures, recursions and loops and things like that. It is fantastic.
